# Quadratic
A quadratic equation solving neural network.

### Step By Step
1. Create/Acquire the Dataset (I'm creating it)
2. Data Preprocessing (I've created it so its already preprocessed)
3. Create the ANN Model

### Coefficeients
```
=> (x - x1)(x - x2)
=> x^2 - (x1 + x2)*x + x1*x2

a = 1
b = -(x1 + x2)
c = x1*x2
```
